This code currently have syntax of Turbo C++ by Neitron.

I'll upload the syntax which works with the modern compilers like Visual Studio soon.

This small guide can be used to use the code and view the prgram.

1. Install Turbo C++ (by Neutron) from any official and legal site.
2. Download and paste the .cpp files in the BIN folder of your Turbo C++ Directory or where your codes are stored.
